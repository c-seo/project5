# Project Title

This project is a playful interactive quiz to see if the player can guess the song lyric to the song title. I created a simple website quiz with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Design Process

For this project, I started by looking at other quizzes. I used to play a lot of quizzes to pass time when I was on a commute to school or work. For this project, I wanted to create something that would allow the user to play and invite them to listen to songs as well. I chose music titles that I grew up with and songs that I hold dear to my heart. Hopefully it brings back the same positive memories for the user as well.



## Challenges

I lack a lot of coding experience, and with a lot of personal life matters as well as academic school pressure, I found it difficult to create this project. I created several htmls but I found it best to narrow it down to two. I found it also difficult to add in p5js speech. I was not able to do so, and if I had more time, I would have liked to add this component as well. Moreover, I would like to add in sound effects or parts of the song to the answer choices. My next steps would be to add p5js speech, sound effects, and visual aspects to the website.
